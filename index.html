        <h1>RESUME</h1>
		<h2>Daniel Tidwell</h2>
        <h2>Graphic Designer, Illustrator, Concept Artist</h2>

        <p>Odd Weather Luck Studios was born the moment I realized that I did not have to limit my creative expression to a single medium, 
        rather, I could use multiple mediums to more completely present my creative vision. I am a multi-skilled designer with specialties in; logo/brand  development, slogan and copywriting, and typographical design. I also am a musician with audio production skills, a photographer / videographer with photo and video editing skills, and finally, I am also an author. All of these skill are drawn upon conceptually and practically to ensure that the design or branding problem can be solved in the most unique and creative way that exemplifies the brand identity of the client. It would be an honor to join you and your buisness for your design journey.

        With Thanks and Regards,
        Dan
        
        An Afternote for the curious: 

        The origin of the name "Odd Weather Luck Studios" comes from an odd phenomena that I experience which I named thusly. The phenomena is a matter of luck, not great luck, but also not bad luck either. My luck seems to only work when I genuinely need it to, and never when I want it to.
